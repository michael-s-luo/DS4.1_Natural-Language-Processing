This repository serves to store and document my completed projects, assignments, and learning materials from the BloomTech Data Science curriculum.
Unit 4.1 focuses on a broad overview of Natural Language Processing and is composed of the following topics:

### 1: Natural Language Processing - Introduction
  * Main topics: Documents - Tokenization, Stop Words, Lemmatization
  * Created Kindle vs FireHD Scattertext based on Amazon product review data
  * Keyword Analysis & Word Cloud visualization of Highly rated (4+ star) vs Lowly rated (3- star) coffee shops reviews

### 2: Vector Representations
Main topics: Documents - Tokenization, Stop Words, Lemmatization
  * Main topics: CountVectorizer and TF-IDF, Document Queries, Word Embedding techniques, Principal Component Analysis
  * Trained NearestNeighbors model to recommend similar BBC articles
  * Vectorized Data Science job listings on Indeed to find matches given input query

### 3: Document Classification
  * Main topics: Document & Text classification pipelines, dimentionality reduction
  * Applied Latent Semantic Indexing to predict topics of news forum posts
  * Combined LSI, spaCy word embeddings, and GridSearch methods to predict Whiskey review topics

### 4: Topic Modeling
  * Main topics: Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Visualizing and Interpreting Topic Models
  * Used LDA to find topic clusters for labelled news forum posts
